# WealthSim UI
This is the Front end for Wealth Simulator written in React. This handles adding, editing, and removing data for 
monte carlo simulations. It displays results and has a chat bot for analyzing results with Artificial Intelligence.
## Examples of page view
You can view a demo of the website at [https://wealthsim-ui.vercel.app/](https://wealthsim-ui.vercel.app/). 
Note: this is a demo of the website and does not have any actual backend or database attached to it. The only way to run the real simulator is to setup the repositories locally.
